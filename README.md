**Frontend developer**, puzzle-solver, and storyteller in code.
I build responsive, human-centered interfaces with **React**, **Next.js**, and **TypeScript**, guided by a passion for clarity and attention to detail.
Outside of work, I recharge through photography, a good book, or a new Sims expansion pack.
Always exploring, always refining, Iâ€™m **open to new frontend roles** and **collaborations**.
